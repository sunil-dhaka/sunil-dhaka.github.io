Hello there, welcome to my home page. Read a post, and send me a postcard.

**`math is not being shown try with internet in default.html scripts and then edit index.md`**
- I think it supports without internet but takes bit time to render into nice math
- how to highlight things like `name-of-snap` in code blocks.
- [ ] links page is not published = false
- some math $0=0$

```bash
snap apt install `name-of-snap`
```
