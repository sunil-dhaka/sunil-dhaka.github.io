## [Relevant Information Retrieval from Text Documents](https://github.com/sunil-dhaka/IR-Project)   
<h4 align="left">Under Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya, CSE, IIT Kanpur <span style="float:right;">Jan '22 - Apr '22</span></h4> 
- Implemented and fine-tuned text summarization algorithms like TextRank, LSA, Google PEGASUS, t5-small
- Preprocessed corpora using a variety of NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization
- Used ROUGE-N to evaluate accuracy of machine summaries against human summaries for corpus of size 230k
- Tested out algorithms and achieved SOTA f1-scores on our datasets for abstractive algorithms after fine-tuning
- Created a Flask web application for users to interact with the algorithms and get summaries of articles or blogs

## [Racial Disparity in COVID-19 Vaccination in US](https://github.com/sunil-dhaka/ime692-project)   
<h4 align="left">Under Prof. Shankar Prawesh, IME, IIT Kanpur <span style="float:right;">Aug '21 - Nov '21</span></h4> 
- Analysed vaccination rates for **covid-19 by race in US counties**, along with their association with socioeconomic factors, using a number of statistical techniques
- Transformed and pre-processed data by **z-score** normalization and **PCA** dimension reduction of feature matrix
- Implemented variety of regression algorithms like **MLR, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest**
- **Fine tuned** the hyper parameters of these algorithms using train and test **MSE as metric** of measure
