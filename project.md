Some of my projects done during my time at IITK
<hr style="border:2px solid">

### [Relevant Information Retrieval from Text Documents](https://github.com/sunil-dhaka/IR-Project)   
<h4 align="left">Under Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya, CSE, IIT Kanpur <span style="float:right;">Jan '22 - Apr '22</span></h4> 
<!-- - Implemented and fine-tuned text summarization algorithms like **TextRank, LSA, Google PEGASUS, t5-small**
- Preprocessed corpora using a variety of NLP techniques like **tokenization, stemming, lemmatization**
- Used **ROUGE-N** to evaluate accuracy of machine summaries against human summaries for corpus of size **230k**
- Tested out algorithms and achieved **SOTA f1-scores on our datasets** for abstractive algorithms after fine-tuning
- Created a **Flask web application** for users to interact with the algorithms and get summaries of articles or blogs -->

### [Racial Disparity in COVID-19 Vaccination in US](https://github.com/sunil-dhaka/racial-disparity-project)   
<h4 align="left">Under Prof. Shankar Prawesh, IME, IIT Kanpur <span style="float:right;">Aug '21 - Nov '21</span></h4> 
<!-- - Analysed vaccination rates for **covid-19 by race in US counties**, along with their association with socioeconomic factors, using a number of statistical techniques
- Transformed and pre-processed data by **z-score** normalization and **PCA** dimension reduction of feature matrix
- Implemented variety of regression algorithms like **MLR, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest**
- **Fine tuned** the hyper parameters of these algorithms using train and test **MSE as metric** of measure   -->

### [Indian Agriculture Data Mining](https://github.com/sunil-dhaka/Agriculture-Analysis-on-Indian-States)   
<h4 align="left">Under Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya, IME, IIT Kanpur <span style="float:right;">Aug '21 - Nov '21</span></h4> 
<!-- - Analysed **seasonal crop data** for last 20 years and unearthed surprising information about the Indian agricultural
- Pre-processed 2.5 lakh data points using **cleaning techniques** to get robust dataset for subsequent steps
- Developed new **categorical variables** of zones and crop to make analysis more understandable and comparative
- Used **geopandas** library to discover the geographical situation of Indian agriculture on zone and crop basis -->

### [Modelling and Forecasting of Time Series Data](https://github.com/sunil-dhaka/time-series-model)   
<h4 align="left">Under Prof. Amit Mitra, MTH, IIT Kanpur <span style="float:right;">Sep '20 - Nov '20</span></h4> 
<!-- - Modeled a **seasonal ARIMA model** to forecast next year's temperatures based on historical data
- Checked data stationarity through **Dickey-Fuller test**, and performed seasonal differencing to ensure stationary TS
- Optimized the model parameters using **Box Jenkins Method** for forecasting purposes
- Performed residual analysis and **information criterion tests** to check model adequacy on the dataset
- Yielded absolute **MAE of 2.2%** on test data for optimized S-ARIMA model   -->

### [Repelling–Attracting Metropolis Algorithm](https://github.com/sunil-dhaka/RAM)   
<h4 align="left">Under Prof. Dootika Vats, MTH, IIT Kanpur <span style="float:right;">Jan '21 - Apr '21</span></h4> 
<!-- - Implemented tweaked version of MH algorithm called Repelling–Attracting Metropolis Algorithm (RAM) for multi-modality
- Used Auxiliary Variable approach to derive the steps of the algorithm
- Demonstrated how the RAM model outperforms the MH sampler, by generating MCMC samples for real-life numerical examples like sensor network localization, strong lens time delay estimation
- RAM provided better simulations for multimodal distributions, as seen by ACF plots, trace plots, acceptance rate and downhill-uphill average proposal numbers of generated samples -->

### [Expectation-Maximization & Metropolis-Hastings Algorithms](https://github.com/sunil-dhaka/)   
<h4 align="left">Under Prof. Dootika Vats, MTH, IIT Kanpur <span style="float:right;">Aug '19 - Nov '19</span></h4> 
<!-- - Developed expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms to fit multivariate Gaussian mixture models for latent variables
- Cross-validated the model on test data to determine optimum values of hyperparameters
- Utilized MH algorithm to implement the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method in Bayesian logistic regression model -->

### [Critical Comparative Appraisal of Monetary Policy Tools and Strategies](https://github.com/sunil-dhaka/)   
<h4 align="left">Under Prof. Sukumar Vellakkal, ECO, IIT Kanpur <span style="float:right;">Aug '21 - Nov '21</span></h4> 
<!-- - Conducted structural comparison of monetary authorities in India and the United States
- Compared monetary policies of these countries including reserve requirements, discount rate, and open market operations
- Critically analyzed various monetary policy strategies employed to control economic variables like unemployment rate, inflation rate, interest rate, GDP, money supply, etc. -->
