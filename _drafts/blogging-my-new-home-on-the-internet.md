I used to have a personal blog when I was in college. It was a freewheeling stream of thought. Then I turned to Facebook. To write and opine about campus affairs or general things I cared about. 

In 2016, when I had just begun reporting, a new world opened to me. I was consuming a lot more information, I had opinions, and I wanted to share it with the world. See this chart I made from my Facebook activity which shows the surge in my social media activity:

_ADD CHART_

I felt good about it. Friends would comment they learnt a thing or two from my status updates. A few would engage and debate. I felt a sense of civic participation. It felt, in some way, an extension of my professional responsibility as a journalist. Promote your work. Talk about issues. Hear out different opinions. 

Same for Twitter. I used to get a kick when I got new followers. Oh, there are strangers who are interested in knowing what I have to say on my Twitter feed. One fine day, the count hit 1,000. Wow. To be sure, I never used social media metrics to evaluate my work, but a higher follower count indicated that people were interested in learning from my stories. I wanted my work to reach a large audience, and it was a slow and good progress. 

Until everything changed. 

I don't when that happened—it was definitely not one moment, but a process—but I developed a deep aversion to social media. When I joined the _Hindustan Times_ to focus on digital storytelling, I got more insight on how information on the internet flows. 

I was done with social media. I thought it's problems outweighed the benefits. Twitter, in most occasions, was a platform to push views. But what I enjoy the most original reporting. I also like opinion columns, but not the ones that are loud. In my initial years of reporting, I figured that the world is insanely complex, and there are no simple answers. But Twitter was a not platform for nuance. Sometime in the summer of 2017—after I read Cal Newport's excellent book _Deep Work_—I went and deleted my Twitter account. I deactivated my Facebook, vowing never to get back again. 

My relationship with social media now stands in the middle—and that remains a topic for a future post. But that initial period serves as an important context for why this blog is coming to life. 

Here is the thing. When I was on Twitter, I felt like going to a party with thousands of people and everyone is taking turns to go on the mike, hoping to catch everyone else's attention. Some are too carefree and want to say something all the time, others were more careful and stingy. I was somewhere in the middle, but in some ways, it was a performance. I really do not remember why I tweeted—there was no end in my head, as far as I remember. The notifications were addictive. Someone noticed. It mattered. 

Simultaneously, I started doing a lot of work social media data. It was quite a revelation for me what one could learn about you just based on publicly available data. More digital trails you leave on the internet, the more you allow people to infer things about you—without proper context. As a privacy conscious person, that also bothered me. A lot. 

And so I stopped. Completely. Even as I joined the platform back—both Facebook and Twitter—my activity was extremely small. Mostly to share my work. I still don't know how to write catchy tweets. I am not good at promoting my work. I did get better at reporting stories, and somewhat better at writing, all relative to my old work. This is based on my internal metric. That I feel ashamed to read some of my past work reflects that my sensibilities have grown and that I am getting better at my craft. 

In this phase, I had a single objective: report, report, report. I love reporting. There is a thrill to find an answer an unanswered question or understand a new development from five different people and then communicate it to a larger audience. Or just tell a story of someone. All of that. 

Most of the times I felt like an idiot. I did not enough to comment on economic policies because boss, my fundamentals were not in place. One fine day I went to Bahrisons and bought five books on Indian economic policy, promising myself I would read economic history, build my framework to understand the Indian economy and then try to make sense of what's happening. Very few op-eds explain or provide insight. Most of them appear to persuade. Thinking about anything from first principles—and ultimately having a mental model, an intellectual framework of sorts—helps you not only figure what you think about a particular issue, and why so. 

When that reality hit me in the face, I surrendered. No more opinion sharing. Learn, report and write. 

Simultaneously, another question bothered me: why am I a journalist? Why do I like this profession?

This blog. Unlike shouting on a loudspeaker in a party, blogging in this space is like having interesting conversations with friends in the college canteen. It's still a public space, it's open to everyone who is interested in hearing,  but this is not a performance. I don't want to persuade them. Just discussion. Thinking out loud. Letting them ask me follow up questions. 

This is what that blog will do for me. It has been a subtle realization over the years that I can't think if I don't write. I can't even learn without writing. Every single time I sit down to write my stream of thoughts about a topic that is not personal, my chain of logic breaks and I go wait, I don't even know this. Or there is a logical inconsistency in my reasoning. Or this is not what I actually believe, what I am saying goes against my fundamental values. Messing around with it to really understand was therapeutic. I loved it. 

But I would only do that for topics I was writing on for publications—or stuff on the side I cared about.
