**Census India**

The time series data is difficult to put together—not impossible. The best thing
about the census is the level of detail, down to the block level. For most purposes, district-level data does the job.

**National Family Health Survey (NFHS)**

-The latest round of NFHS came out earlier this year. You can download the
unit-level data from the DHS website. It is one of the largest sample surveys
ever done and it is a goldmine for stories. We published a couple of fun
stories: “How India eats” and “How India gets high” using this data. Mint has
done some good stuff too. There is a lot more to be explored. For now, check out
their reports, questionnaires etc to see what lies there. If that’s interesting
for you, we can discuss later how to work with it.

* What’s so special about this: it is representative at the district level. We
have never had access to such detailed district-level data ever before.

**National Sample Survey Organisation**

Read about NSSO and IHDS. The quality of NSSO is questionable (I have reported
on that too) but that’s the most important dataset in India — most of our
policies are driven by that data. So we can’t ignore it. The unit-level data is
not available for free. Universities have access. If you have some questions
that you think NSSO can answer and want more, tell Roshan: his can get his
friends in JNU to pull those numbers for you.
