Math & Stats grad from IIT Kanpur with a Machine Learning minor. I'm into all things AI and deep learning - always curious about what's next in the field. I love tinkering with new ML/AI tech and seeing how it can solve real problems.

**Interests:** ML/AI/DL, NLP, Computer Vision, Algorithms, Math & Stats, Economics, Public Policy, Data Stories

**What is this website for?**

Mostly a portfolio and a place to jot down technical notes for my future self. If something here happens to help you too, that's a bonus.
