Hello!

**A bit about myself**
I did my bachelors and masters in maths and scientific computing from iit kanpur. I have a passion for exploring the resserach frontiers in deep learning and artificial intelligence, and see how they can be used to solve the problems at hand. I love to read recent research papers in AI, ML and data science. 

My work interests lie in AI, natural language processing, computer vision, DSA, mathematics & statistics. You can find out more about my Projects, Work Experiences, Resume, and some blogs on this website.


**What is this website for?**
It is a reference website for technical things that might come handy for future myself. If it helps, then good for you.
