Hello!

Math & Stats grad from IIT Kanpur with a Machine Learning minor. I'm into all things AI and deep learning - always curious about what's next in the field. I love tinkering with new ML/AI tech and seeing how it can solve real problems. Check out my projects, work experience, and thoughts in the blog section.

**Interests:** ML/AI, NLP, Computer Vision, Algorithms, Math & Stats

Cheers!

**What is this website for?**

Primarily a portfolio website. It is also a reference website for technical things that might come handy for future myself. If it helps, then good for you.
