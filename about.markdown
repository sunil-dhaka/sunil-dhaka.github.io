Hello â˜»! My name is Sunil Dhaka. I am a post graduate student at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in). My interest are statistics, data mining, social sciences, and computers. My passtime hobby is binge â˜» watching a good fantasy webseries. I also like to write on occasions of self-realizations or world-realizations. That is enough, I guess. Explore this website ðŸŽ¬.
