Do not learn anything new. Do not do any physical activity. Do not walk or run. Do not have ambition for the next 2 years. Do not improvement your speaking skills.

Treat your present situation as permanent and accept it. Do not new ideas. Do not take any risks. Marry so that you can feel stable without a good earning.

Have mental rut over everything in a day. Have petty fights. Binge watch TV shows or movies. Expect the money to come to you, but do not make any effort. Get attached to the place where you are staying. Be disappointed with the job. Do the same kind of tasks repeatedly. Have unrealistic goals and never make any progress in achieving them. Believe that you can achieve anything. When someone achieves something, tell them that you can also achieve that easily.

Be chronically tired. Be without energy. You have grand thoughts, do not take the first step because you might not be that good.

Do not work on your emotional intelligence and workplace skills. Do not read how to navigate human interactions in family and workplace contexts. Do not try to have a clear idea of what is happening around. Have narrative based on whichever is the news source comfortable to you. You do not practice healthy skepticism.

You do not eat healthy food regularly. You do not have good personal body hygiene, oral hygiene, and digital hygiene. You do not keep track of your account balances and transactions. You do not know your monthly expense. You do not have money to survive few months without a job. You do not have practical way of looking at life. You hate your job. After the work, you come home, eat and sleep.

You follow romanticism. You check your email 100 times a day, even though you are sure such adventure was never successful. You are surrounded by constant interruptions. You dread boredom. You want be surrounded by fireworks all the time.

Your attention span is very short. You are impatient. You expect things happen in no time.

You depend on your friends for happiness. You do not have much concern for your self-worth.
