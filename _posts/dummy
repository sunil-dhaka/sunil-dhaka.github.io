In this timely column (Aadhaar verdict), Yamini Aiyar, president and chief executive of Centre for Policy Research, argues that “much of the debate and experimentation with technology is based on the flawed assumption that technology can allow us to bypass State failures.”

> This is best understood by examining the link between corruption in welfare programmes and identification — the primary rationale offered and endorsed by the Supreme Court for linking Aadhaar to government subsidies. As a technology, Aadhaar is designed to address the problem of false identity or ghost beneficiaries. But, as activists and researchers have repeatedly pointed out, ghost beneficiaries are not the only form of corruption. In Jharkhand, for instance, Karthik Muralidharan’s work on PDS highlights that quantity fraud, where legitimate beneficiaries were given only a fraction of their entitlement, rather than identity fraud was the key driver of corruption. In Rajasthan, an Id-insights study finds that non-availability of ration was a key reason beneficiaries did not receive PDS.

The point is that Aadhaar and associated technologies are only as effective as the problem they are trying to solve.
