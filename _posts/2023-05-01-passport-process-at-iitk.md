For students who wish to create a passport at IITK:
- Create a bonafide certificate: This is a very important document for students. One can create a passport without it. However, with it, the process at PSK, Kanpur becomes much smoother. How to create one:
   - Get a hall residence slip from the respective Hall office (it is the proof of residence)
   - Fill [this](https://www.iitk.ac.in/dosa/Application-form-for-Bonafide-Certificate.pdf) form for passport purposes
   - Attach the slip with the bonafide form and give it to your department's HOD office/office where the office helper works
   - The department office forwards it to DOSA office, and the registrar creates your bonafide in 1-2 working days
   - Go and get it from DOSA

- Online application and appointment schedule: It is a standard procedure that you should be able to handle
   - Now apply for a passport online on this [website](passportindia.gov.in/)
   - Pay the amount as per the type of passport normal, tatkal, or renew, etc.
   - Schedule an appointment at [PSK, Kanpur](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Passport+Seva+Kendra,+Kanpur/@26.4744859,80.3092828,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bd4c10e813c9f27:0xfe3168cc82aaaf62!8m2!3d26.4744811!4d80.3118577!16s%2Fg%2F124ygkv70)
- Offline process at PSK: This is the most important step
   - Go 10-15 minutes before your appointment. And remember, you are not the only one in your batch. Generally, they have 20-30 people in a single batch. 
   - Now, once inside PSK, **don't waste your time on the inquiry window line, line up for the token window** (time-saving tip)
   - Also, take one photocopy of all documents mentioned at the end (time and money-saving tip)
   - Show photocopies of docs [sign them all] at the tatkal window and get a token number
   - Go to the first floor after getting a token, and here begins the process of waiting (mostly) and getting shit done
      * A. Processing Unit: Original docs get scanned, photo taken, fingerprints, sign. There are two screens, and they ask you to verify your details as they are filling it. On A window, all are private employees. 
      * B. Verification Unit: Lots of waiting, and then you go before one government official who checks your docs and judges you :)
      * C. Granting Unit: Lots of waiting, and then once more government official checks something and grants your application for police verification
- Police verification: This whole process takes about 15-20 days. The police are slow
   - After 2-3 days of getting passport grant (an email message), some police officer calls and asks you to submit copies of docs to IIT police chocki, type-A
   - You can check your status on the passport website
   - Kalyanpur thana checks documents and sends a report to SP office, Kanpur Nagar
   - SP office gets back to PSK, and all done
- Printing and speed post from Lucknow: 3-4 days to reach IIT sub-post office
