# Navigating the Passport Application Process at IITK

Getting your passport while studying at IIT Kanpur? I've been through it recently and thought I'd share my experience to make your journey smoother. Here's my step-by-step guide:

## Step 1: Obtain a Bonafide Certificate
This little document is pure gold for students. While technically you can apply without it, having a bonafide certificate makes the PSK Kanpur process significantly smoother. Here's how to get one:

- Visit your Hall office and request a residence slip (this proves where you live)
- Download and fill [this form](https://www.iitk.ac.in/dosa/Application-form-for-Bonafide-Certificate.pdf), specifying it's for passport purposes
- Attach your residence slip to the bonafide form
- Submit everything to your department's HOD office
- The department will forward it to the DOSA office, and the registrar will create your bonafide in 1-2 working days
- Finally, pick it up from the DOSA office

## Step 2: Online Application and Appointment Booking
This part follows the standard process for everyone in India:

- Apply for your passport on the [official website](https://passportindia.gov.in/)
- Pay the appropriate fee based on your application type (normal, tatkal, renewal, etc.)
- Schedule an appointment at [PSK Kanpur](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Passport+Seva+Kendra,+Kanpur/@26.4744859,80.3092828,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bd4c10e813c9f27:0xfe3168cc82aaaf62!8m2!3d26.4744811!4d80.3118577!16s%2Fg%2F124ygkv70)

## Step 3: Visit the PSK Office
This is where the real adventure begins:

- Arrive 10-15 minutes before your appointment (remember, you'll be in a batch with 20-30 other applicants)
- **Pro tip**: Skip the inquiry window and head straight to the token window line — huge time saver!
- Bring one photocopy of all required documents (listed below) — saves both time and money
- Sign all photocopies before showing them at the counter to get your token number
- After receiving your token, proceed to the first floor where the main processing happens:
  - **Station A** (Processing Unit): Your original documents get scanned, photo taken, fingerprints recorded, and signature captured. Staff will fill your details while you verify them on dual screens.
  - **Station B** (Verification Unit): Prepare for some waiting, then meet a government official who'll scrutinize your documents and application.
  - **Station C** (Granting Unit): More waiting, followed by a final check by another government official who approves your application for police verification.

## Step 4: Police Verification
This part requires patience:

- Within 2-3 days of your PSK visit, a police officer will call asking you to submit document copies to IIT police chowki, Type-A
- You can track your application status on the passport website
- The Kalyanpur police station reviews your documents and forwards a report to the SP office, Kanpur Nagar
- The SP office communicates back to PSK

## Step 5: Final Delivery
After successful verification, your passport gets printed in Lucknow and delivered by speed post to the IIT sub-post office within 3-4 days.

## Essential Documents
- Original bonafide certificate
- Identification proof (Aadhar preferred, but PAN/Voter ID also works)
- 10th and 12th marksheets
- Institute ID card

Hope this helps simplify your passport journey at IITK! Feel free to reach out if you have questions.
