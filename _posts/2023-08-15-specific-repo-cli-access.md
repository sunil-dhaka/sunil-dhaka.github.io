To set up authentication for only one specific repository to add commits from the terminal, you can use the following steps. This involves using a personal access token (PAT) for authentication, which you'll generate on your version control platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

Assuming you're using GitHub as an example:

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):**
   - Log in to your GitHub account.
   - Go to your profile settings.
   - Navigate to "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens."
   - Click on "Generate new token.", `can use fine grained tokens` 
   - Give your token a name, and select the scopes or permissions needed (typically at least "repo" and "user:email" for committing and accessing your email).
   - Click "Generate token" and make sure to copy the generated token immediately.

2. **Set the PAT as a Remote URL:**
   - In your terminal, navigate to the repository's directory.
   - Check the current remote URL of the repository using:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```
   - If the remote URL uses HTTPS, update it to include your PAT. Replace `<your-token>` with the actual token you generated:
     ```bash
     git remote set-url origin https://<your-token>@github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
     ```
     If the remote URL uses SSH, update it to include the PAT in the URL. Replace `<your-token>` with the actual token you generated:
     ```bash
     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<repository>.git:<your-token>
     ```

3. **Configure Local Git Settings:**
   - Configure your local Git settings for this repository:
     ```bash
     git config user.name "Your Name"
     git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
     ```

4. **Commit and Push with the Remote URL:**
   - Make your changes to the repository, add them to the staging area, and commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Your commit message"
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```
     Replace `"Your commit message"` with your actual commit message and `<branch-name>` with the branch you want to push to.

By using the PAT in the remote URL, you're providing authentication for only this specific repository. You won't need to enter your username and password for every commit; the PAT acts as the authentication token.

Please note that the steps may slightly differ if you're using a different version control platform. Always refer to the documentation of the platform you're using for specific instructions on generating tokens and configuring authentication.
