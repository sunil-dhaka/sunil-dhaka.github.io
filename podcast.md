Ideas and new information can have a different meaning if interpreted out of context. That’s one of the great things about podcasts: it retains context.

“As part of the online world that hasn’t destroyed its own context is podcasting,” futurist Jaron Lanier said in his excellent book “Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now”.

> Podcasters are real people, known to the listener. Podcasts are episodic, so they build a sense of personality and context. The listener can’t—as yet—jump around audio content as easily as she or he can jump around content that’s presented visually, like a website or a video. So a listener’s actual experience is more like the experience podcaster imagines it will be…

Podcasts constitute a significant proportion of my information diet. Here are some of my favorite shows.

**<a href="https://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast" target='_blank'>Ezra Klein Show</a>**<br>
*Vox Media*<br>

It is a long form interview podcast and can extend from anything between 60 to 90 minutes. The show takes you inside the heads of leading thinkers, writers, newsmakers, and power players in politics, policy and media. I have learnt a lot about how to learn about the world listening to this podcast. The conversation never disappoints me.

**<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily" target='_blank'>The Daily</a>**<br>
*New York Times*

I am one of the one million people who listen to *The Daily* (almost) daily. Hosted by the excellent Michael Barbaro (there is something magical about his voice, I don’t know what), the podcast is another version of the New York Times front page.

> This is how the news should sound. Twenty minutes a day, five days a week, hosted by Michael Barbaro and powered by New York Times journalism.

It is pretty much centered around American politics and helps me understand the crazy world of Donald Trump’s presidency. Few episodes are about global affairs, few about technology as well.

The Daily takes a step back, provides deep context, explains the news and helps the listener figure out what’s really going on.

**<a href="">Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher</a>**<br>
*Recode*

If you are interested in technology and you don’t know Kara Swisher, you are missing out. She is awesome.

> One of tech's most prominent journalists, Kara Swisher is known for her insightful reporting and straight-shooting style. Listen in as she hosts hard-hitting interviews about the week in tech with influential business leaders and outspoken personalities from media, politics and more.

**<a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained" target="_blank">Today, Explained</a>**<br>
*Vox Media*

This, like NYT’s *The Daily*, is Vox.com's daily explainer podcast. 

> This is Vox's daily explainer podcast — bringing you the biggest news every day with guests, context, radio drama, and more. 

Even though centered around American Politics, I find it more broad based than *The Daily*.

**<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/podcasts/caliphate-isis-rukmini-callimachi.html" target="_blank">Caliphate</a>**<br>
*New York Times*

The Caliphate is an audio series following Rukmini Callimachi, who covers terrorism for the New York Times, as she reports on the Islamic State and the fall of Mosul. This ten-part audio documentary series made me realise the power of audio storytelling. If you are interested in understanding ISIS, I strongly recommend this. It’s brilliant.

**<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/04/27/135599807/about-planet-money" target="_blank">Planet Money</a>**<br>
*NPR*

This podcast demonstrates how one can simplify complicated issues and make important things interesting. 

> Imagine you could call up a friend and say, "Meet me at the bar and tell me what's going on with the economy." Now imagine that's actually a fun evening. That's what we're going for at Planet Money.

You will definitely find something interesting if you start digging into Planet Money archives.

**<a href="https://www.recode.net/recode-media-podcast
" target="_blank">Recode Media with Peter Kafka</a>**<br>
*New York Times*

For those thinking about the future of news, this is a must listen. Given the pace at which media landscape is changing and the challenges of the digital era, the podcast gives insight into the minds of industry leaders and thinkers.   

> Listen to the future of media, today. Recode Senior Editor Peter Kafka talks to the most interesting people in media and technology, to find out what happens when those two things collide. Tune in for smart, thoughtful, BS-free interviews.

**<a href="http://revisionisthistory.com/" target="_blank">Revisionist History</a>**<br>
*Panoply*

Malcolm Gladwell, the host of this podcast, is one of the master storytellers of our time.

> Revisionist History is Malcolm Gladwell's journey through the overlooked and the misunderstood. Every episode re-examines something from the past—an event, a person, an idea, even a song—and asks whether we got it right the first time. Because sometimes the past deserves a second chance.

You can listen to this even ten years from now and you will find it fresh and amazing.
