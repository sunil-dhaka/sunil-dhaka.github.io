I"ù<p>In this video we are going to parse information on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRVhX1weTUd_hs_mcpfwcOq18tSdL0y60">some</a> channelâ€™s content and store it into a csv file. Mainly information about video title, video discription, how many time it has been watched etc. I have given a step by step procedure, with that you should be able to parse detail about YT video on any playlist. Explanations are in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> comments.</p>
