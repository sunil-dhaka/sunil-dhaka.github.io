India's food regulator proposed changes in labeling rules to empower consumers: if the quantity of fat/salt/sugar exceeds a specified threshold, food packets would have a front-of-pack warning label. But this policy is not moving, following fierce opposition from the industry. 

My interviews with scientists, government officials, independent experts and a review of documents obtained under the RTI Act—including meeting minutes of FSSAI panels and hundreds of comments submitted by the food industry on the draft law—show how debates between industry and government keep moving from one committee to another and the unresolved conflicts stay on the table. As a result, India’s attempt to regulate highfat, sugar and salt (HFSS) foods is stuck for five years now. The story explores these tensions and explains what's at stake.

<b>Two-part series investigating low-cost ventilators buily by AgVa Healthcare, procured by Indian government during COVID-19</b> *HuffPost India*

In the last week of May 2020, we began working on a story on what we thought would be a celebration of Indian ingenuity: A startup called AgVa had teamed up with Maruti Suzuki to build what they claimed was the world's cheapest, smallest and most advanced ventilator.

They had just bagged an order to supply 10,000 ventilators under the PMCARES fund.

As our investigation progressed, we were troubled by what we found: Doctors who had used AgVa ventilators shared their accounts, former employees described a worrying lack of rigour and confessed how the company had fudges software, and two government clinical evaluation committees said the ventilators were not suitable for ICUs and should only be used in hospitals that had backups.

*Hindustan Times | October 10, 2017*

Police departments across India, dozens of unemployed people, and placement agents all agree: online job scams are rampant. A scarcity of jobs and the anonymity of the Internet are enabling an Indian industry built around fake job promises. Why are so many people being tricked? How much money are they losing? How does this industry operate? Through the summer of 2017, a colleague and I followed two young job seekers through a fraudulent placement network in Delhi consisting of recruitment agencies, training centres, job websites and call centres until one of them gave up after being cheated of her money and the other ended up as a job scammer. <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/interactives/inside-fake-job-industry/">Read full story here.</a>

*Livemint | January 15, 2020*

Encryption forms the backbone of secure cyberspace. It helps to protect the data we send, receive or store. Behind the high degree of confidence in the security of the most commonly used encryption algorithms, like RSA, lies an assumption: modern computers, including the fastest supercomputers, will take forever to factor a large number that is a product of two prime numbers.

That is about to change. We are heading into the era of quantum computing, the technology that will exponentially speed-up the processing power of classical computers, and solve problems that today’s fastest supercomputers can’t even touch in a few seconds.

That also includes the ability to factor large numbers, meaning the underlying assumptions powering modern encryption won’t hold when a practical quantum computer becomes a reality, which can lead to a complete breakdown of the current encryption infrastructure.

As the US and China lead the global race in quantum tech, India lags far behind. Why is that? Read the story to know more.

*Livemint | December 12, 2019*

Indian parliament tabled the “Personal Data Protection Act, 2019" in December 2019. The bill is essentially a data governance framework that forces organizations dealing with people’s personal data to relook at data management, and regulates practices to protect individual privacy and personal data. It defines what they can and can’t do.In the story, I explain what the provisions of the proposed legislation mean for individuals, organisations, regulator and the government.

Key point: the bill in the current form is a step forward to protect an individual’s data from private corporations but two steps backwards in placing safeguards from government surveillance—fundamentally hurting the premise of citizens’ privacy protection. If the government wants to empower individuals, they need to cede some of their own powers.

*HuffPost India | January 27, 2019*

The built-in social network of the personal mobile application of the Indian Prime Minister works like Twitter, where any user who signs up on the platform can post any piece of content (images, videos, website links). The visible lack of content moderation leaves the app as vulnerable to communal propaganda and fake news as Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter. While the American platforms have come under scrutiny for the presence of misleading and polarising content, the NaMo app has been off the radar.

From blatant lies to partially true polarising content to violent hate speech, the platforms built for the “next billion” internet users face the same challenges for which American social media giants such as Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp are facing intense scrutiny. However, as India tightens control over misleading and defamatory content shared online ahead of state and national elections, the focus is almost entirely off vernacular networks.
